Movie search is a frontend website made with React.js, mobile first, fully responsive and dynamic.

### Frontend of this application:

The frontend app has been built with React.js. I used React Query and installed the npm package Axios library to make CRUD HTTP requests to Rest API. To fetch JSON data from the API I used the useQuery hook, and in order to create and delete data I used the useMutation hook.
